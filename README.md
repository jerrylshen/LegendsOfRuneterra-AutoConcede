## Legends Of Runeterra Auto Concede AI Script
If you like what I've done, please give my repo a star:)

### What it does
Assuming LoR is open, it clicks on Play -> VS AI -> picks the first deck -> \*Play -> Passes two turns -> Setting -> Surrender -> Ok -> Play
\*Loops 10 times, [why only 10 times?](https://github.com/jerrylshen/LegendsOfRuneterra-AutoConcede/blob/master/README.md#why-auto-concede-against-ai-10-times)
Total XP gain: 350


### Prerequisite stuff

[optional] An editor, if you want to edit the code
